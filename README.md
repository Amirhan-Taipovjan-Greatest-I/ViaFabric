**Client-side and server-side ViaVersion implementation for Fabric**

Allows the connection to/from different Minecraft versions on your Minecraft client/server (LAN worlds too)

This mod supports 1.14.4/1.15.x (on `ver/1.14` branch) and 1.16 snapshots (on `master` branch) with Fabric Loader. Check the Minecraft version in file name when downloading from GitHub Releases.

Note: ViaVersion is not designed for modded Minecraft with modified registries
