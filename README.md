**Client-side and server-side ViaVersion implementation for Fabric**

Allows the connection to/from different Minecraft versions on your Minecraft client/server (LAN worlds too)

This mod supports 1.14.4/1.15.x with Fabric modding API

Note: ViaVersion is not designed for modded Minecraft with modified registries


Dependencies:

ViaVersion 3.0.0+ - dev builds at https://ci.viaversion.com/job/ViaVersion-Abstraction/

Fabric Textures v0, Fabric Resource Loader v0, Fabric Commands v0 - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api

(Optional) Cotton Client Commands - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cotton-client-commands

With ViaVersion only:
- your server can accept newer versions
- your client can connect to older versions


Adding ViaBackwards (and optionally ViaRewind):
- your server can accept older versions
- your client can connect to newer versions
