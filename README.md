**Client-side and server-side ViaVersion implementation for Fabric**

Allows the connection to/from different Minecraft versions on your Minecraft client/server

## WARNING
**I can not guarantee that this mod is allowed on every (or even any) server. This mod may cause problems with anti cheat plugins. USE AT OWN RISK**

This mod supports 1.14.4/1.15.x with Fabric modding API

With ViaVersion only:
- your server can accept newer versions
- your client can connect to older versions


Adding ViaBackwards (and optionally ViaRewind):
- your server can accept older versions
- your client can connect to newer versions
